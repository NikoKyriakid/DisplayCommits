      "body": "This is an attempted resolution to issue #100 . The resolution implemented is to disable the click behaviour outside of the range, this is though a technical compromise. Arguably if development effort was not a factor the ideal solution would be to retain the click drag behaviour to define new scrub range, but prevent the buggy behaviour when just a click is triggered.\n\nSee the trello ticket for further details as to why this compromise was chosen https://trello.com/c/3E2HNwYO. TLDR: Would require the disabling and rewriting of considerable d3 brush logic to get the intended behaviour",
